## Since I have been focusing my job search mainly on a Front End Developer position I have had an interesting time finding ways to practice and build my portfolio. Some of the main things I feel I need to focus on to be job-ready are mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I decided to put together a small list of my favourite resources.

* Front end mentor is by far my favourite finds so far for front end challenges they give you a design package and you use your skillset to bring them to life with code.***  https://www.frontendmentor.io/***

* Flexbox zombie is a great site to master Flexbox which is very important when you are working on those challenges above.*** https://mastery.games/p/flexbox-zombies***
 
* CSS Grid will change how you create website layouts. CSS Grid is also very important with page layout. *** https://cssgrid.io/  https://cssgridgarden.com/
 ***
* Wes Bos's Javascript 30 course gives you a deep dive into Javascript which is important to help bring some life into those designs. *** https://javascript30.com/***
