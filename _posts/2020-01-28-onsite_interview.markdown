 An onsite interview is that phase of the interview process that occurs at the companies site. Generally, the interview process starts with a phone interview for initial assessment, then usually a technical interview to assess your coding abilities, or a take-home challenging exercise to complete. Once youâ€™ve successfully gone through this screening phase, the company might invite you for an onsite interview, which is the final phase.

I just recently completed my first onsite interview and I have to say it was a whirlwind. Regrettably, I did not know what to expect outside of the regular google searches that say you'll interview with managers team members and engineers. Normally, it involves a coding challenge of sorts on a whiteboard with some technical questions.

This is how my day went! My interview was set for 3 pm in Boston. I arrived at the office to sign in about 20 minutes early to make sure I got through security. from there I was greeted by the hr representative at the door who introduced herself before preceding to show me to the room I would spend my next couple of hours in. She then informs me that I will be meeting with two of the managers( this is kind of what was expected per my googling ). after the managers entered the room and introduced themselves then started to ask me regular hr questions like Tell us how you got into coding, describe a project on your resume how you came up with the idea and what technologies you used, and lastly tell me about a time you persevered from a challenge. They made me feel very comfortable and I think it went really well. then the second round came.

For the second round, I was introduced to two of the Sr. Developers. once they began interviewing they also asked me to walk them through a project form my portfolio explaining to them challenges I had to overcome during creating it. then they asked some general technical questions such as the keyword "this" in JS, The https protocol, what kind of data structures I've used and why.  after the general questions, I was handed two sheets of black and white paper with a bunch of javascript functions and objects. I was then told to find all the syntax errors and explain why each one was wrong. This proved to be a lot harder than I thought under pressure with two people starring at you.
After about 20 minutes of scouring over the code, I found 5 of the 7 errors and they pointed out the rest of them.  I began to ask them questions about there day to day activities, what technologies they are most interested in using among many other questions before concluding the interview.
