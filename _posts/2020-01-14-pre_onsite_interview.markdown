After a month of job searching and interview, I finally had my first onsite interview! I found this unconventional as I was expecting a remote technical interview first but I can't complain. It all started last week I did a phone screen at company X with Mr T. It was the standard HR cultural interview he asked some basic questions, for example, Tell me about yourself?, What made you decide to switch into software engineering?, and What made you interested in applying with Company X?  After waiting a couple of days I received an email asking me to come into the main office for an Onsite!

Once I set the Interview date I had to prepare! See I am one of those people who gets a little anxious about interviewing in general, so I had to figure out how to best use my time it was 2 days away! I figure the best use of my time was to split it up into a few different things. I first started running through coding challenges I tried to mainly focus on the most common like string reversal, frequency counter, sliding window. Once I spent some time on coding challenges I decided that it would be a good idea to get out my trusty rubber duck and walk through my two react projects. I went through both projects and explained the technologies used and why I decided to use them. The last thing I decided to do was go over common terminology and definitions for things like "Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS", "What is a promise", and "Explain what asynchronous functions are". IM not sure how anyone else went about preparing for an onsite interview but so far this is my best option!
