This is it my final project in the Flatiron course work! It has been a real journey filled with sleepless nights and weekends spent at home hiding away in my room coding the days away and Lots of caffeine. Looking back now at when I started I can't believe the progress I have made during the past year. Not only have I grown as an individual but also as a programmer. Last year I could hardly write an if statement or a for a loop now I can create whatever I can dream up. It still takes a lot of research and planning. There's still so much I don't know but I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me in this career path.

 I am a coffee addict I love everything about it.  I wanted to create something that involved my love for coffee, but also I wanted to create something that would relate to a real-world scenario. I chose to create an online ordering platform for an imaginary local coffee shop named Koffee.

This application makes use of Rails as an API to store all my local data such as products created orders and user authentication and serialize it into JSON for API calls form the front-end.  For front-end, I used react-redux with Materialize UI to creat all the different presentational and container components. Customers will use this Application to shop and place orders to pick up in-store or have delivered to there home.

The biggest challenge for me so far during this project has been Authentication with JWT tokens vs using the devise gem and getting my shopping cart to dynamically update its state on the front end before placing orders.
