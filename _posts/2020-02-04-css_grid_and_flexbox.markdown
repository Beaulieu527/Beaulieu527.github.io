For a variety of web layouts,  You might want to use either CSS grid or Flexbox. Each layout technique has its pros and cons as well as ideal use case scenarios.

# **Flexbox**

Flex includes many sub-properties that can be especially useful. For example, flex-grow and flex-shrink allow columns to change width and proportion depending on the user’s view. Justify-content allows for evenly spaced items or perfect centring. This is a great tool to let smaller UI elements look their best on any device. Unfortunately, if you want to layout larger elements on the page, you would probably want to add margins and then do a little math. Also, each section of your design must be a row with a separate flex tag on it. This rules out using flex for more complexly designed grid systems. 

# **Css Grid**

With grid, it’s easy to set up an entire layout design system for your website, you’ll have your styling up and running in no time. Layouts may be nested within other layouts and grid also allows you to create extremely complex arrangements with precision. Grid isn’t best for quick centring or placing an image within a larger text article. These types of layouts are best handled through other methods.


# **What’s Best?**

The best would be the layout method that requires the least amount of lines in CSS to achieve the most complex layout. Grid wins. Its syntax is efficient. However, I think there’s a place for all the layout methods, and they can and should be combined where necessary.
