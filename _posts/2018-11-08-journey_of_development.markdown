There are many reasons and ways an individual chooses a career it could be because of passion, compensation or benefits. Growing up, I always had a passion for problem-solving, and I knew that I wanted to be in a career that expressed that in some way. I hear stories of software engineers who always knew that they were going to work with computers because they started tinkering with then ag a young age building simple programs or just learning to code as a hobby, I, unfortunately was not one of those children. 

I've worked many different jobs in many fields from carpentry, telecommunications, and manufacturing technologies. all of these jobs had a few things in common from building a product people could use to having to solve technical issues, but for some reason, they never felt like a good fit for me in the long term something was missing. It wasn't until  I stumbled upon a free platform that taught you the basics of programming. I decided to enroll  to check it out. A few lessons in you write a small CLI program that asks for a users name, and then outputs a greeting. I was hooked! The idea of learning a new language that you could "speak" to a computer to solve problems and build new programs was so exciting to me. After a few more lessons and tons of research I decided this is my next career path and I was admitted into the part-time Software Engineering course here at FlatIron School. **Now the journey of development really begins!
