For my third project in the flatiron course, I decided to do a continuation of my Sinatra project Hikt. Hikt is for people who love the outdoors and hiking and want to keep track of which hiking trails they have "Hikt". With the use of this app, a user is able to create an account either by filling out a Sign Up for or by signing up with Facebook. Once they are signed in, they can browse Hiking trails that other users have added to the database and also leave reviews. If they would like, they can create a Hike by adding a picture, location summary and length. 

For now, the app is pretty cut and dry but in the future, with the knowledge I attain in the upcoming modules I plan on adding a magnitude of features including but not limited to: 

* Making calls to an API so that a user can search by town, state or even country to find different    hiking trails.

* Star rating system

* User dashboard with hikes completed, created, reviewed and liked
 
*  Create an admin account 

*  More to be decided as knowledge grows
