Wow, I can't believe I am coming up on the first month of my career search already. It doesn't seem like that long ago I was working on my React project and preparing for the final assessment. so much has changed over the past two months its incredible. I went from working a job I hated, packed up everything I owned made the trek back up to Massachusetts all while working on my final project and preparing for the assessment. I can say as daunting as all that was it wasn't until I got here that reality set in, I had to start thinking about what I wanted after the program.

After I graduated my part-time cohort I did some reflecting I had a lot to think about before I started my career search. Locations were the first monster I had to tackle see I moved home while I started my search but this is not where I would end up after some soul searching and realised I wanted to stay pretty close to family and friends so I decided NYC and Boston would be my most suitable choices. Then it was time to figure out what kind of position I wanted. As a carpenter before my journey as a developer, I founded a real passion for devising tangible projects an enthusiasm I think I could also fulfil as aFront End Developer.

Ok, this is great I figured out locations also what role I want to achieve, let's begin applying. I was extremely excited to get to this point everything io worked hard for the past year was coming into fruition and I was finally searching for my dream job! I did what every sensible person looking for a job did, I joined every relevant job board I could find and started applying away writing cover letters filling out applications reaching out to recruiters and network connections the past few weeks. Perversely even with numerous applications drifting around, and unanswered outreach emails, you start to get a little discouraged it's normal but I always tell myself the right job is out there!
So far I have applied to around 150 jobs from which I have had 4 phone screens and tomorrow will be my first onsite. No matter what happens I am excited to keep this journey going and find that dream job!
